# AssetPack

An AssetPack is a collection of all assets needed by your addon. It's pretty much just your addon's resource pack. However,
the format differs a lot from a vanilla resource pack.  
To start off, create an `assets` directory in your addon's resources folder.

## Asset Index Files

Depending on what you want to do, you can create a file called `materials.json` for custom items and blocks, `guis.json` for custom GUIs,
and/or `armor.json` for custom armor textures. These files are called asset index files, as they're an index of the assets
that you're adding to the game.
