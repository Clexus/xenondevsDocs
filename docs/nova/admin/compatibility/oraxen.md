# Oraxen (work in progress)

Oraxen was previously marked as a "compatible" plugin. However, due to changes in both Nova and Oraxen,
they can currently not be called compatible. [We're already working on fixing compatibility issues between Nova and Oraxen](https://github.com/xenondevs/Nova/tree/oraxen-integration).
